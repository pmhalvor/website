                    Currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at <ahref="www.schibsted.com">Schibsted</a>
                    In 2022, I completed my master's degree in Data Science at the University of Oslo, 
                    with a specialization in language technology and sentiment analysis.
                    I have experience in data wrangling, machine learning, devops,   
                    web development, and a solid background in mathematics.

                    My favorite genre of music is currently progrssive house, with LoFi-hiphop in a close second.
                    Harry Potter over Lord of the Rings, but mainly becuase I have yet to 
                    read the latter.
                    When it comes to sports, it's endurance over sprints, since thats what 
                    the human body was made for.
