# perhalvorsen.com Release v1.0.2: Dynamic Cv

Hello and welcome to my site!


This second release presents the cv page dynamically.
Each entry is a stored as a row in a database where this site is hosted from.



The site should be used as a portfolio, shining light on some of the projects I've taken part in. 
If there are any malfunctions on your end, send me an email or pull request, and I'll work on 
fixing it.
