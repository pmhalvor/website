# perhalvorsen.com Release v1.0.3: Dynamic Home Page

Hello and welcome to my site!


This third release presents the home page dynamically.
Each recently updated post is pulled from a database where the updates are tracked.



The site should be used as a portfolio, shining light on some of the projects I've taken part in. 
If there are any malfunctions on your end, send me an email or pull request, and I'll work on 
fixing it.
