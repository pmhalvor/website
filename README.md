# perhalvorsen.com Release v1.0.1: Static

Hello and welcome to my site!

This first release is the same implementation of the site that was released previously at 
[pmhalvor.github.io/site](https://github.com/pmhalvor/site_old). 
_Note: the repository has changed location to:_ 
[github.com/pmhalvor/site_old](https://github.com/pmhalvor.site_old) 


The site should be used as a portfolio, shining light on some of the projects I've taken part in. 
If there are any malfunctions on your end, send me an email or pull request, and I'll work on 
fixing it.
