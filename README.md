# perhalvorsen.com Release v1.0.4: Dynamic Notes Page

Hello and welcome to my site!


This release presents the notes page dynamically. A database on the server tracks the following columns:
-----------------------------------------------------
|  id  |  title  |  descr  |  file_loc  |  img_loc  |
-----------------------------------------------------


Changelog:
- 1.0.4: Notes stored in database on server. Page items are pulled dynamically using Django.
- 1.0.3: Home page updates stored in database on server. Items pulled dynamically from Django.
- 1.0.2: Cv entries stored in database. Served dynamically using Django.
- 1.0.1: Static site from previous deploy hosted from server. 



I use this site as a portfolio, shining light on some of the projects I've taken part in. 
If there are any malfunctions on your end, send me an email or pull request, and I'll work on 
fixing it.
