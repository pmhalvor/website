# perhalvorsen.com 
Repository for my personal website, [perhalvorsen.com](https://perhalvorsen.com).

Changes are pushed to ghcr.io/pmhavor/website (PAT needed).
On my server, I use [watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) to automatically update the site when a new image is pushed to the registry.


I use this site as a portfolio, 
showcasing some of the web-development projects I've taken part in.
If you noticed anything wrong, feel free to open a PR.
